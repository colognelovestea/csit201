			Lola Amour is a hobby gone wild made up of 7 people who met in high school. Over the last five years, the band has grown into one of the most established artists in the country's indie music scene, having performed in some of the country's biggest shows like UST's Paskuhan, UP Fair: Cosmos, Wanderland Music Festival; and headlining on television for Coke Studio PH Season 3.<br><br>Their unique sound has kept them from being boxed into any broad genres and has been rapidly evolving with every release.
